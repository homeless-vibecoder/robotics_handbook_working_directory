Iteration with state

Suppose optimization problems can be solved with iteration using state. How expressive is iteration with state?

There is an analogy between iteration (in time) and an image (that both are structures - optimization is like: measure y, do x, ... - image is like: this pixel has color a, etc.).
PID and other control algorithms are like compression algorithm for images: just like constant color is frequent in images, monotonic motion is common in iteration, so having momentum acts as a compression algorithm.
