More specific ideas - not necessarily better:

Complex numbers, Quaternions

Splines - a good approximation/interpolation tool

PID

Understanding derivative as a control variable - need of planning ahead of time

Few tricks (to prevent division by zero, perhaps some good code-writing practices - e.g. assert)
    - trying to attack the issue of gaussian error in measurements/movements - do not use numbers as you expect them - use them under gaussian error

Fine-tuning parameters with learning/optimization/RL
