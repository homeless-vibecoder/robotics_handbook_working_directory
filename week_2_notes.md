Review:
1) line_follower_plan
2) cascading controls

Questions:
1) what to do next: simulations/graphs or more content? Is it a good idea to possibly reduce the scope?

Topics to discuss:
1) How should we classify timescales (scale + order - is there anything else to be added and is it a good/useful classification).
2) How beginner-friendly should the explanations be (line follower motion decomposition)? - asking people would be too hard. maybe it is a good idea to look at introductory course material (and how well students understand it)
