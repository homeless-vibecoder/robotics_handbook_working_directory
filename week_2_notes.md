Good ideas:



Main things to review:
0) General plan/good ideas
1) Motor speed control structure
2) Line follower plan/structure
Would be nice if we find more "lessons" we can put in.
3) IMPORTANT: analogy between line follower and motor speed control - is it worth doing this PID analogy or is there a better analogy to be made?

Questions:
1) How beginner-friendly should the explanations be (line follower motion decomposition)? - asking people would be too hard. maybe it is a good idea to look at introductory course material (and how well students understand it)
2) Is it worth mentioning that we control $x'''$ in line follower? Is the section too unclear?
