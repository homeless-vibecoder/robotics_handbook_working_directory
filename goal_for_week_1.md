Goal is to come up with rough draft/form of control and PID section.

1) control is about controlling variable, over which we have indirect control
2) is there case, where we have control, not over some derivative of x, but something else? - so that our cost isn't an integral, but something else - how to combine/turn a function into a number.
3) Analyze PID
4) Analyze line follower robot
