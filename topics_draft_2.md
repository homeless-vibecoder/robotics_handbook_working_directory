Control:
PID
tunable algorithms
stable operations (no zerodivision, other useful things that address the fact that everything in a robot has gaussian error)


Geometry:
Complex numbers, Quaternions
robotic arm

Representation of state:
Make the idea more explicit (weighted average implicitly defines this) - more general method of using memory (stored in current state)
Sensor fusion


Troubeshooting, tuning - issues that require observation on what the robot is doing:
collecting data and analysing (not entirely sure about specifics)

IDEA: have a separate section for what topics/research should be done.
building structure on an image for correspondence, etc. - image is hard to match, since there is basically no way to efficiently tell if matching is going well - you have to match whole thing. Also, symmetries need to be taken care of.
